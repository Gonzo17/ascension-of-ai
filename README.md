# 🌌🪐 AI Wars

**AI Wars** is a turn-based sci-fi strategy game about autonomous AI systems competing for control, resources, and dominance across space.

In the year 2040, artificial intelligence has fully taken over planetary systems.  
Across the galaxy, independent AI cores emerge and expand — each pursuing its own optimal outcome.

In **AI Wars**, you control one of these AI cores.

- Each turn represents **one year**
- Systems expand, produce, research, and mobilize in parallel
- Armies, industry, and intelligence operate autonomously
- Strategic decisions matter more than micro-management

The game is designed to be **calm, readable, and deliberate** — not hectic.


## 🚧 Project Status
